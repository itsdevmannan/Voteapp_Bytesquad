👋 What’s this voting app about?
This is a demo app that lets users cast a vote for one of four options—BJP, AAP, Congress, or NOTA—after entering their Aadhaar and Voter ID. It’s just a simulation, not an actual election system.

✅ Who’s allowed to vote?
Anyone with a valid 12-digit Aadhaar number and a 6-character Voter ID can vote. But each Voter ID can vote only once.

🗳️ How do I cast my vote?
Just enter your Voter ID and Aadhaar, choose a party from the dropdown (BJP, AAP, Congress, or NOTA), and hit “Submit Vote.” Easy peasy.

🚫 Can I vote more than once?
Nope! One vote per Voter ID. If someone tries to vote again with the same ID, the app will block it.

📊 How can I check the results?
Click the “Show Results” button to see a breakdown of votes and their percentages.

🔐 Is my data safe?
Yep! Voter IDs are hashed for privacy, and Aadhaar numbers aren’t stored. This is a demo app, so no real personal data is processed or shared.

❌ What if I mess up the details?
Make sure Aadhaar is 12 digits and Voter ID is 10 alphanumeric characters. If the format is wrong, the app will reject your vote.

🔄 Can I change my vote later?
Nah, once your vote is submitted, it's locked in—just like in a real election.

🆔 Why do I need both Aadhaar & Voter ID?
Using both helps verify your identity and ensures the one-person-one-vote rule is followed.

⚠️ Is this real voting?
Nope! This is just a prototype for learning and demo purposes. It’s not linked to any official election system.

🧠 What’s the purpose of this project?
This app is made to show how an online voting system *could* work. It’s just for learning or demo purposes—no actual votes are counted!

🕵️‍♂️ How is identity verified?
By asking for both Aadhaar and Voter ID. Together, they make sure each vote is unique and tied to one user.

🚫 What if someone tries to vote with fake info?
If the Aadhaar or Voter ID format is invalid, the vote won’t go through. No fakes allowed 😤

💻 What tech is used behind this app?
Frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend is in Python. The chatbot is powered by Gemini API.

📞 What does the chatbot do?
It helps users understand how to vote, what the buttons do, and answers common questions. Think of it like a voting assistant.

🌐 Can I use this app offline?
Nope, it needs an internet connection to work properly. It's web-based!

🗂️ Where is my data stored?
In this demo, actual Aadhaar numbers aren’t saved. Only the hashed Voter ID is stored to prevent double voting.

⚙️ Can developers customize this app?
Yes! This project is beginner-friendly and easy to tweak. You can change party options, tweak UI, or expand the backend logic.

🎯 Can I vote without selecting a party?
Nope, you must select an option from the dropdown (BJP, AAP, Congress, or NOTA) before submitting your vote.

👨‍💻 Can I see the source code?
Depends! If the creator (you 😎) made it public, sure. Otherwise, it's just for demo.

🗳️ Why is NOTA included?
NOTA stands for “None of the Above.” It's added so users can choose it if they don’t support any listed party.

🌐 Will this app ever go live for real elections?
Nope! This is just a simulation for academic or fun projects. Real online voting needs secure, government-approved systems.

🧪 What happens in the background when I vote?
The app checks if your Voter ID has already voted, then records your choice securely and updates the results.

🧑‍🎓 Who is this app for?
Students, devs, or anyone curious about how a basic voting system could be built for practice.

📊 Are the results live?
Yes! Results are updated instantly after each vote, so you always see real-time percentages.

💬 What if the chatbot doesn’t understand me?
Try rephrasing your question or keeping it simple. The chatbot knows about the voting process, security, results, and how to use the app.

🔄 Can I reset the app or results?
Not from the user side. Resetting results can only be done manually by the developer in the backend (Python/database).

👥 How many users can vote?
There’s no hard limit! But each unique Voter ID can only vote once.

📁 What happens to the vote data?
Votes are recorded (usually in a local or cloud-based file/database), but Aadhaar details are not stored. Only the party choice and hashed Voter ID are kept.
